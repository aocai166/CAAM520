== Code and documentation ==

Code was graded based on the file HW1_CG.c.
- line 97: Please do not use sqrtf() for double precision numbers.
- line 114: memset() cannot be used this way. This will not set each element of
  the vector u to 1.0, i.e., the initial guess is wrong.
  (-3 pts.)
- line 162: Please report the error in the infinity norm, not in the 2-norm.
  (-3 pts.)
- line 163: Note that clock() returns CPU time, not elapsed real time.
  Furthermore, CLOCKS_PER_SEC is not actually the number of clock ticks per
  second (https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/CPU-Time.html)
- Please document your code in the report, including code snippets (see 4th item
  on the problem sheet).
  (-3 pts.)


== Verification and operation counts ==

- Note that multiplication with zero elements is not trivial.
  There is at least the cost of fetching the entry from memory before we can see
  that it is zero.
- Please show results for N=10,20,30.
  (-8 pts.)


== Documentation of number of iterations, timings, and scaling results ==

- The segmentation fault at N=50000 occurs, because N*N cannot be represented
  by int. Try to use size_t instead.
- In general, CG will take more than one iteration. The reason why it converges
  in one iteration here is probably the incorrect initial guess.
