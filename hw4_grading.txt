20/20 points: code runs

11/15 points: good code practices
- syncthreads unnecessary in global compute_xk
- use (N+2)x(N+2) thread array vs NxN thread array (wasted threads for compute_xk)

15/15 points: discussion of parallelization strategy 

10/15 points: discussion of code verification
- differing number of iterations between serial/CUDA code, no comparison of error.

5/15 points: provide throughput and bandwidth
- computational throughput not provided, total bandwidth not reported

15/15 points: roofline and computational discussion

Extra credit: 5/25 points
- "line"-based shared memory is the right idea, though it doesn't increase data locality (which is the goal of smem)
- no need to read b in shared memory (no repeated reads!)
- no performance analysis. 

-9 -10 + 5 = -14 = 86
Total: 86/100
