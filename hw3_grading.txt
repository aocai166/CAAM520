General remarks:
- You refer to the solution as a "wavefield." Please note that the Poisson problem does not model waves.
- The CG method only converges in a single iteration for this specific problem and because you start with an initial guess of zero.
  Notice that you cannot set the inital guess to one using memset(). I pointed this out previously.
- Performance should be identical with the serial code and when using a single OpenMP thread. Yet, you observe a significant difference. Did you do any other performance optimizations?

[ ] Discussion of code verification (15 pts.)
    - Your results show that the errors and iteration counts are similar for different numbers of threads, but there is not discussion of the verification. (-10 pts.)
[ ] Plots of measured parallel performance and speedups (20 pts.)
    - Speedups and plots are missing, only the elapsed time is reported. (-10 pts.)
